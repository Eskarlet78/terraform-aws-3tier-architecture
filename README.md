# Terraform AWS 3-Tier Production Architecture

This project provisions a scalable, secure, production-style 3-tier infrastructure on AWS using Terraform.

It demonstrates real-world cloud architecture and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices used by DevOps and Cloud Engineers.

---

## Architecture Overview

```
Internet
   ↓
Application Load Balancer (Public Subnets)
   ↓
Auto Scaling EC2 App Servers (Private App Subnets)
   ↓
RDS MySQL Database (Private DB Subnets)
```

---

## What This Project Builds

### Networking
- Custom VPC
- Public, Private App, and Private DB subnets
- Internet Gateway (IGW)
- NAT Gateway for private outbound access
- Route tables and associations

### Security
- Tier-based Security Groups
- Internet → ALB → App → DB traffic flow
- Database not publicly accessible

### Compute Layer
- Launch Template
- Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- EC2 instances in private subnets

### Load Balancing
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Target Groups and health checks

### Database Layer
- RDS MySQL instance
- DB Subnet Group (private subnets only)

### Terraform Best Practices
- Modular structure
- Environment separation (dev)
- Remote state (S3)
- State locking (DynamoDB)

## Prerequisites

Before using this project:

- AWS account
- IAM user with programmatic access
- AWS CLI installed
- Terraform installed

---

## Configure AWS Credentials

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter:
- Access Key
- Secret Key
- Region (e.g. ap-south-1)

---

## Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anirudht2025/terraform-aws-3tier-architecture.git
cd terraform-aws-3tier-architecture/environments/dev
```

---

## Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Type `yes` when prompted.

After deployment, Terraform outputs the ALB DNS name. Open it in your browser to see:

```
Hello from App Server
```

---

## Destroy Infrastructure

To avoid AWS charges:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- AWS networking and security
- Scalable architecture design
- Load balancing and auto scaling
- Private database deployment
- Remote state management
- Modular Terraform design
